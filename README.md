# Game-of-CardMatch

In the game of CardMatch, cards have a color (blue, green, red, or yellow) and a value between 0 and 9. At the start of the game, 

each player is dealt a hand of five cards, and a single card is turned over to form the beginning of a discard pile.

Players take turns attempting to discard a single card from their hands. In order to discard a card, the card must match either the color or the value 

of the card at the top of the discard pile. For example, if the card at the top of the discard pile is a green 5, a player could play either a green 

card of any value or a 5 card of any color. If a player has no cards that match the top of the discard pile, they must draw a card and wait until their 
next turn.
The game continues until a player has no cards left or until a player has 10 cards in their hand. At the end of the game, the player whose final hand 

has the smallest total value wins the game and earns the total value of the other playersâ€™ final hands. To reduce the likelihood of a player winning 

with 10 cards, a penalty of 20 points is added to the value of any hand with 10 cards. If there are two or more players whose hands are tied the same 

smallest final value, no one wins any points.
